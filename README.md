# UniLesson

UniLesson is a mobile portal that connects university students in crisis with graduate students or about to graduate, giving the possibility to book university repetitions

# Features

UniLesson allow "teacher-users" to sign-up and later add a new lesson to the DB. A lesson consists of:
  - a "contents-image", with the arguments of the lesson
  - the description of the lesson, with potentially other important information
  - the location where the lesson will be done
  - tags
  
The "teacher-user" can track the lessons added to the DB and see how are going with the feedback. Each lesson can receive a "+1" feedback from "student-users" who ideally have done the lesson and had a good learning time.

UniLesson allow "student-users" to sign-up and later search a lesson using a search-bar. Here the student can insert a keyword like a name/surname, an argument, tags, ect. All the lessons conformed with the keyword are displayed and sorted by geolocation and ranking, so the first lesson is the nearest to the user with the high ranking. On a tap the lesson will show all the necessary information.
